    "While studying machine learning theory over the past year or so, I came across an interesting theorem that really sparked my interest. The [Universal Function Approximator]() states that any neural network can fit a dataset (fix this later). When I read that for the first time, I almost did a double take because I was so surprised that something like that could be true. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about what it really means. It's basically saying that if, for example, you're given a set of n training inputs X where each x_i in X is some k-dimensional vector and you have a set of n training labels Y where each y_i in Y is a label from {0,1} (binary classification), then you will be able to generate a neural network (with one hidden layer) that is able be trained to classify every single one of those n examples correctly. \n",

    "That was ridiculously interesting to me when I first saw it. \n",

    "And it made me think \"Well, if this theorem is true, shouldn't neural networks be perfect at pretty much any task?\". The key here, though, is that we encounter a **generalization** and **overfitting** problem when we try to fit a neural net too tightly to a particular training set, and expect the same results on the testing set.

This does back up the theorem that any dataset (like MNIST) can be fully fit with a single hidden layer neural network, **provided that we have a sufficiently large number of hidden units**. However, the crux of this topic lies in the problem that the test accuracy of the smaller network actually turned out to be greater than the accuracy of the larger network that was able to fully fit to the dataset.

    "So, what's the moral of the story? Yes, a neural network can fit any dataset and can approximate any function, but the question is **\"Should you allow it to?\"**. When a neural network gets so fit to a particular training dataset, it isn't able to properly generalize, and that's when the test accuracy (which really is the most important metric in an ML system) drops. Our particular network got so fit to the training set because our model complexity was too high in that we had an extremely large number of hidden units. This was necessary to get the 100% classification accuracy on the train set, but hurt our ability to do well on the test set. The key in a lot of machine learning models is to find that crucial balance between having a network that is complex enough to fit the training data, and simple enough to be able to generalize to examples it hasn't seen before.
